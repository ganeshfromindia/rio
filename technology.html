				<h3 class="mtb25">Process & Cost Optimization</h3>
				<p>Why are engineers interested in optimization? What benefits result from using this method rather 
					than making decisions intuitively? Typical problems in chemical engineering process design or 
					plant operation have many (possibly an infinite number) solutions. Optimization is concerned with 
					selecting the best among the entire set by efficient quantitative methods. This article is commenting 
					some of them.
				</p>
				<p>Optimization Provides the fields of science, engineering, and business. A typical 
					engineering problem can be posed as follows: A process can be represented by some 
					equations or perhaps solely by experimental data. You have a single performance criterion 
					in mind such as minimum cost
				</p>
				<p>The goal of optimization is to find the values of the variables in the process that yield 
					the best value of the performance criterion. A trade-off usually exists between capital 
					and operating costs. The described factors, process or model and the performance 
					criterion-constitute the optimization problem.;
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
				<h3 class="mtb25">Why Optimize?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Saves Process Times</li>
					<li>Saves Labor</li>
					<li>Saves Electricity</li>
					<li>Saves Cost of Consumables</li>
					<li>Saves Cost of Water</li>
					<li>Saves on ETP Cost</li>
					<li>Improves out put</li>
					<li>Increase plant productivity</li>
					<li>Faster Delivery Schedules</li>
					<li>Saves Huge Cost</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Engineers work to improve the initial design of equipment and strive to enhance the 
					operation of that equipment once it is installed so as to realize the largest production, 
					the greatest profit, the minimum cost, the least energy usage, and so on.
				</p>
				<p>In plant operations, benefits arise from improved plant performance, such as improved 
					yields of valuable products, reduced energy consumption, higher processing rates, and 
					longer times between shutdowns.
				</p>
				<p>Optimization can also lead to reduced maintenance costs, less equipment wear, and better 
					staff utilization. In addition, intangible benefits arise from the interactions among 
					plant operators, engineers, and management.
				</p>
				<p>It is extremely helpful to systematically identify the objective, constraints, and degrees 
					of freedom in a process or a plant, leading to such benefits as improved quality of 
					design, faster and more reliable troubleshooting, and faster decision making'
				</p>
				<p>Predicting benefits must be done with care. Design and operating variables in most plants 
					are always coupled in some way. If the fuel bill for a distillation column is $3000 
					per day, a 5-percent savings may justify an energy conservation project.
				</p>
				<p>In a unit operation such as distillation, however, it is incorrect to simply sum the heat 
					exchanger duties and claim a percentage reduction in total heat required. A reduction in 
					the reboiler heat duty may influence both the product purity, which can translate to a 
					change in profits, and the condenser cooling requirements. Hence, it may be misleading to 
					ignore the indirect and coupled effects that process variables have on costs.

				<h3 class="mtb25">Scope of Optimization Problems</h3>
				<p>From a practical standpoint, we define the optimization task as follows: given a system or process, 
					find the best solution to this process within constraints. This task requires the following elements:
				</p>
				<ul class="mb-30">
					<li>An objective functionis needed that provides a scalar quantitative performance 
						measure that needs to be minimized or maximized. This can be the systems cost, 
						yield, profit, etc 
					</li>
					<li>A predictive modelis required that describes the behavior of the system. For the 
						optimization problem, this translates into a set of equations and inequalities that 
						are called constraints. These constraints comprise a feasible region that defines 
						limits of performance for the system.</li>
					<li>Variablesthat appear in the predictive model must be adjusted to satisfy the 
						constraints. This can usually be accomplished with multiple instances of variable 
						values</li>
